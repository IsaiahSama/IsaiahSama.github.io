      <h3>What is Discord</h3>
      <p>Discord is an American VoIP, instant messaging and digital distribution platform designed for creating
        communities. Users communicate with voice calls, video calls, text messaging, media and files in private chats
        or as part of communities called "servers."</p>
      <h3>What is a Discord Bot</h3>
      <p>Discord bots are AIs that can perform a number of useful automated tasks on your server, such as welcoming new
        members, moderating content, and banning rule breakers. You can use Discord bot commands to add music, memes,
        games, and other content to your server.</p>
      <h3>What do I do</h3>
      <p>My goal here is to create custom discord bots for servers/users which can serve and handle a wide array of
        tasks (except music). The only real limit is your imagination (and discord itself :] )</p>
