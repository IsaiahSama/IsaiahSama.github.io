      <h2>Some Insight</h2>
      <p>I, Isaiah, am a self-taught python programmer, aspiring to be a data scientist. I tend to work on coding projects fairly quickly, yet still prioritizing ease of use, which is one of the factors that inspired me to start selling my services. I'm currently a student at the University of the West Indies Cave Hill Campus, doing a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics. If you wish to see some of my certificates, feel free to checkout my LinkedIn page using the Social Media tab in the navbar. For more information about me, refer to <a href="about.html">here</a>.</p>

      <h3>What is a Discord Bot</h3>
      <p>Discord bots are AIs that can perform a number of useful automated tasks on your server, such as welcoming new
        members, moderating content, and banning rule breakers. You can use Discord bot commands to add activities, memes,
        games, and other content to your server.</p>
      <h3>What do I do</h3>
      <p>My goal here is to create custom discord bots for servers/users which can serve and handle a wide array of
        tasks (except music). The only real limit is your imagination (and discord itself). By default, all discord
        bots that I create will be tailored for a specific server unless otherwise specified. Feel free to come to me with any ideas you might have, as I have no problem learning new technologies in order to satisfy your needs.</p>

      <h3>Take note of the following</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>For this service, a consultation fee of $50 USD is required.</li>
        <li>The Base Prices listed below are exactly that, base prices. Prices will then scale based on project complexity.</li>
        <li>A fee of $10 USD will be required per month for bot hosting</li>
        <li>My bots are designed using evolutionary prototyping. Therefore, I will begin with your request in a basic form, and then continue to develop and improve on it.</li>
        <li>For bots that are to be designed for more than 1 server, an extra $5 USD will be requested</li>
        <li>One of my greatest traits is my development time, which is generally very fast.</li>
        <li>I do not make Music Bots</li>
