      <h2>Who am I </h2>
      <p> My name is Isaiah Carrington and I am currently a 17 year old student at the University of the West Indies. I
        am
        a passionate aspiring data scientist versed in computer software, compuer science and programming, using the
        python language in particular.
        I have been programming for about 2 years now, starting with web dev, to Lua, then Cpp, but have now decided to
        settle with python with the aim of becoming a data scientist in the field of Machine Learning and A.I
        development.
        I'm always looking for new challenges to take on as to further develop my own skills, so feel free to ask for
        whatever, and once it is within reason, I shall do my best.

      <h2>About I.I.S</h2>
      <p>Isaiah's Innovative Solutions, was brought about when I did a job for another UWI student, which required me to
        use skills that I had been honing.
        On completion of the request, accompanied by the positive feedback, I began to feel really good at finally being
        given the opportunity to use the skills that I had acquired and finally put them to use in a business like
        manner.
        This... was the beginning. Immediately after I decided that I wanted to begin going down the path of a
        freelancer.
        Going through secondary school I was continously told about my skills in computer science and programming, so I
        decided I would like to also offer lessons in those areas. Despite learning python using my own means in my own
        time, I am also fully confident in my ability to share my knowledge.
        And finally, having been using and experimenting with computer software for many years, I've finally decided to
        put together these acquired skills and create what is now known as Isaiah's Innovative Solutions</p>
