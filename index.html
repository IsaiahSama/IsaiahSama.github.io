      <h3>Who am I </h3>
      <p> My name is Isaiah Carrington and I am currently a 17 year old student at the University of the West Indies. I
        am
        a passionate aspiring data scientist versed in computer software, compuer science and programming, using the
        python language in particular.
        I have been programming for about 2 years now, starting with web dev, to Lua, then Cpp, but have now decided to
        settle with python with the aim of becoming a data scientist in the field of Machine Learning and A.I
        development.
        I'm always looking for new challenges to take on as to further develop my own skills, so feel free to ask for
        whatever, and once it is within reason, I shall do my best.
      </p>

      <h3>About I.I.S</h3>
      <p>Isaiah's Innovative Solutions, was brought about when I did a job for another UWI student, which required me to
        use skills that I had been honing.
        On completion of the request, accompanied by the positive feedback, I began to feel really good at finally being
        given the opportunity to use the skills that I had acquired and finally put them to use in a business like
        manner.
        This... was the beginning. Immediately after I decided that I wanted to begin going down the path of a
        freelancer.
        Going through secondary school I was continously told about my skills in computer science and programming, so I
        decided I would like to also offer lessons in those areas. Despite learning python using my own means in my own
        time, I am also fully confident in my ability to share my knowledge.
        And finally, having been using and experimenting with computer software for many years, I've finally decided to
        put together these acquired skills and create what is now known as Isaiah's Innovative Solutions</p>

      <h3>What is Discord</h3>
      <p>Discord is an American VoIP, instant messaging and digital distribution platform designed for creating
        communities. Users communicate with voice calls, video calls, text messaging, media and files in private chats
        or as part of communities called "servers."</p>
      <h3>What is a Discord Bot</h3>
      <p>Discord bots are AIs that can perform a number of useful automated tasks on your server, such as welcoming new
        members, moderating content, and banning rule breakers. You can use Discord bot commands to add music, memes,
        games, and other content to your server.</p>
      <h3>What do I do</h3>
      <p>My goal here is to create custom discord bots for servers/users which can serve and handle a wide array of
        tasks (except music). The only real limit is your imagination (and discord itself :] )</p>
