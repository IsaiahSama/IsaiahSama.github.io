            There are several drafts thusfar, and you can view them all in the google drive link below. 
            With the drive link, you'll be able to leave comments as well, that I can then use to further improve my writing! Enjoy!

Whenever the time for a scheduled event approaches, you will receive a notification on your system.</p>
                <p>Note: I have an updated version that is functional, but I want to add in an update feature. Until I find time to add in the feature, I'm keeping the updated one hidden.</p>
