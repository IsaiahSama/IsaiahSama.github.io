Had some issues with the repo, so the repo page currently only has the first part of it. I will however, re-write the code and make commits, so that the building process is documented.</p>

                <p>Pyautogui is a library which allows for automation of your computer. Such as controlling the mouse, keyboard, even recognizing images on the screen.

                <p>A Schedule Keeper I made using Python. One of my first and favourite programs. As the name implies, it's a program that is used to keep schedules. You can have multiple schedules, with different frequencies, such as Daily, Weekly, and One-time. Whenever the time for a scheduled event approaches, you will receive a notification on your system.</p>
