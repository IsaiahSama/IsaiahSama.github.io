        <p>
          Currently, I'm working on various documents, for simplicity I refer to
          them as books, each providing guidelines and information on
          programming concepts that I would have learned over the years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each link apart from the google drive, contains the latest draft for
          that document. Note: Most are unfinished as I write them when I find
          free time, which isn't that common.
