            <p>My name is Isaiah Carrington, Founder of Isaiah's Innovative Solutions. I am currently 17 years old and a
                student in my preliminary year, doing a Double Major in Computer Science and Mathematics at the
                University of The West Indies Cavehill Campus. I am a self taught programmer specializing in Python. My
                goal is to become a Data Scientist and get into Machine Learning and AI Creation, and Isaiah's
                Innovative Solutions was developed to help me build the connections
                necessary and to begin working towards my goal.</p>

            <h1 id="origin">The Origin of Isaiah's Innovative Solutions</h1>
            <p>The concept for Isaiah's Innovative Solutions came about when I was given the job of creating a
                presentation for a UWI student by my Robotics mentor using my recently developed skills in Scratch
                Programming on
                the 26th November 2020. I had thoughts of starting my own business in the programming field for about a
                year, but all I was missing was a push, actually doing it. I had completed the job on the 27th November
                2020. On the 29th of November, 2020, I made up my mind that I would no longer just sit around thinking
                about starting a business, but that I would actually start pushing towards it. Originally, the name I
                had was Isaiah's Innovations, however, on talking it over with my partner, I decided on Isaiah's
                Innovative Solutions. About a week after the job, I received word that the presentation was warmly
                accepted and that my client's group had received a good grade for their project. This one job helped me
                to realize that I had the confidence needed and was finally ready to start putting my skills to use.</p>

        <article id="my_programming_journey">
            <h1 id="journey">My Programming Journey</h1>
            <h2>The Beginning</h2>
            <p>I've been interested in computers from about the time I was 7 years old, but I really only started to get
                into programming in July 2017 (13). I started to develop an interest in programming because of Cortana.
                I was fascinated by how she worked, all of her functionality, the way how all I had to do was say her
                name and she would respond, the way how she was able to recognise the words that I would say, and then
                even be able to ignore voices that were not my own. All of these factors and more led me to realize how
                cool and powerful Artificial Intelligence really could be. I was inspired to make my own to surpass her
                one day. And so, with some research, I discovered that Python is a very good language for Machine
                Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI). I began by learning Python 2 using Sololearn. It was a bit
                tedious, but I was having alot of fun. All I had to do was speak the same language, and I was able to
                have it do anything I wanted, create anything I wanted. It was like my own genie with unlimited wishes
                in a sense. I was the only one of all of the family members and people that I knew at the time that was
                into programming, so whenever I wanted help, I ended up happily either reading the documentations, or
                asking google a question. </p>

            <h2>My First Task</h2>
            <p>My programming in Python 2 had been just for me, just me learning and trying to improve, I never had to
                do anything for anyone, I was just trying to improve so I could eventually work for a big tech company
                and be able to help out alot of people. That was my idea back then. During October - November 2017, I
                had been asked me for my help in a project by my mother who was a student at the University Of The West
                Indies Cavehill Campus at the time. The part of the project that I was to help in was to create a mobile
                app using MIT App Inventor, to do a particular task. I had never dealt with MIT App Inventor before, but
                I was given a problem, and the developer stirring inside me wanted to solve it. Using youtube and
                google, I learnt how to use MIT App Inventor and was able to make the project in about a week. This was
                the first time that I had been able to use my technological skills for someone else, and it was alot of
                fun.</p>

            <h2>Web Development</h2>
            <p>After messing around with Python 2 and MIT App Inventor for a few months, I was met with 2 problems.
                <ol>
                    <li>The computer I was using no longer worked, so I had to use my mother's. But because it was her
                        main one, my time on it was limited.</li>
                    <li>School</li>
                </ol>
                Due to these 2 factors, my interest in the topic that I was teaching myself slowly vanished. On the 24
                September 2018, I registered for a Computer Coding Camp held by the Caribbean Science Foundation, where
                I would spend the next 4 months learning about the web development basics (html, css, and Javascript).
                Back then I had developed a passion for Web Development, and put alot of my time into it to make sure
                that I understood everything. However, due to me having to share my mother's laptop, there were some
                classes that I could not attend, and others that I was not able to fully take advantage of. Despite
                that, I still was able to learn alot and make a decent project along with the members of my team. The
                reason why I was so vested in web development was because, like a fair amount of other things I do, I
                thought it was cool. Even before my interest in programming, the internet was my friend. I had been
                using different websites for so long, but not once had I really thought about how it was made, or why it
                works. To me, it just did. Now I was given the opportunity to learn the how and the why behind the
                websites that I had been using for years, and then was gifted the ability to make my own. It was
                honestly amazing. All I had to do was open my text editor of choice, type a few lines of markup language
                and I was on my way to creating a whole new project.</p>

            <h2>The Cooldown & Switch</h2>
            <p>I continued to use and attempt to improve at web development for about a year straight. However, my
                interest was more on learning Javascript, than it was on html and css. The reason was because my web
                design skills aren't all of that XD. So I decided that I would try to make up for it with functionality.
                Learning Javascript was a big thing for me. During the camp, we learnt alot of stuff, but by actually
                interacting with other programmers in a Discord Server I was in, I learnt far more efficient ways to do
                the same things that I was doing before. However, from around March 2019, I decided to take a break, and
                therefore stopped learning programming.</p>
            <p>
                July 2019, I decided I wanted to get into game development. My mother no longer used her laptop as much,
                so I had alot more time on it and decided I would use it to pursue an interest. I, like alot of other
                children, love games. I would often play them for hours on end, on PC, PlaysStation2, NDS and even some
                Leap Frog products. I did some research and discovered that C++ was a brilliant language for game
                development. So I downloaded an Acrobat Document called "Guide to C++", and began to teach myself the
                language. I made a good few projects, and managed to stick with the language until February 2020. <br>
                <img src="/images/guide.png" alt="Image of CPP"><br>
                <i>Guide to C++ document used to teach myself the language.</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                During the period of November 2019 - February 2020, I started to lose interest in C++ because I couldn't
                figure out how to get graphics in. So my good few projects that I made were all CLI (Command Line
                Interface) driven. Because I wanted to actually see more than just words on the screen, I picked up web
                development once again and was constantly switching between the two. From Januray 2020, I had received
                my own laptop so developing was also a bit easier and I had alot more freedom as well.
            </p>

            <p>Near the middle of February, I decided that I wanted to switch over to Linux - Ubuntu for a few reasons.
                <ol>
                    <li>I thought it was cool and developer like</li>
                    <li>I thought it looked cool when I would install packages and watch all of the terminal code run
                        down my screen</li>
                    <li>I thought it was cool to use something different to everyone else that they hadn't even heard of
                        before.</li>
                </ol>
                All in all, I thought it was cool XD. There I had gotten used to how weird the VIM text editor was, and
                it quickly became my favourite (Before, I had been using Notepad++ for web development, and Dev C++ for
                Cpp). Unfortunately, this didn't last long. I began to feel a bad about no longer being able to play
                alot of games with my friends, because the laptop I was using wasn't powerful enough to handle a windows
                virtual environment, (trust me I tried... alot). Then I began to get issues with Ubuntu itself, where it
                would just stop responding from time to time. I assumed that this was a problem with my device itself
                and, sadly, made the switch back to windows. Then I got an issue with my laptop. I wasn't sure if the
                charger had stopped working, or if there was something wrong with the port. So I stupidly tried another
                charger to test it and... it worked... then never again. So then I came to the conclusion that by using
                a different charger, I had fried the insides, and then that laptop never turned on again. So I was back
                using my mother's. This incident happened in late March. From here, I went on another break.
            </p>

            <h2>The Rise Of Python</h2>
            <p>2nd of June, 2020. With my mother's laptop once again, my interest in AI and Machine Learning was
                rekindled. A factor of this was CodeBullet, a youtuber who makes amazing A.I and inspired me to be
                interested in it again. I was ready to take on Python again, this time Python 3. With my mind set on
                being a Data Scientist once again, I began to put things in place. On this same day, I watched a 4 hour
                video from freecodecamp.org, and made several small projects to help me learn the language. <br><img
                    src="/images/learningpython.PNG" height="50%" alt=""><br><i>Projects made while learning
                    python</i><br></p>

            <p>On April 6th, I created my github account. On the 12th of June 2020, I started working on my first large
                project. A Discord Bot by the name of Isaiah's Parade. This was both very helpful and limiting at the
                same time. The python wrappy for discord, (discord.py) although easy to use, isn't really all that
                tailored for new python developers such as myself. So using it took asking alot of questions from the
                python and discord.py Discord servers that I was in, and alot of trial and error. As much knowledge that
                I was gaining while using this library, all of my knowledge was mainly about the library itself. Before
                I knew it, I had been swallowed in discord.py, unable to break out and learn the parts of python that I
                really wanted to learn. This had to change.</p>

            <p>On the 17th of August, I received an email stating that I was invited to start learning on Coursera. I
                registered for it by the 19th of August, confirmed by account on 20th, and immediately enrolled into a 5
                part course being offered by the University of Michigan, Python For Everybody, which I completed with an
                Honours on September 10th 2020. <br><img src="/images/certificate.PNG" width='40%' alt=""><br><i>Image
                    of Certificate received on completing the course.</i><br><br> With this course completed, I felt as
                though I were equipped with all of the basic tools I needed to get started, and I began improving on my
                skills.</p>

            <h2>Robotics & Scratch</h2>
            <p>During the period of late July to Early August, I met with the mentor of the Barbados Robotics Team,
                Matthew Douglas. After telling him about my goal in being a Data Scientist, I was invited to become a
                member of the Team. Because of my experience, I was tasked with creating the website for the Team, and
                was soon a Team Leader. Even though Robotics in itself was not a passion of mine, I loved knowing that I
                would be able to code robots, and the amount of opportunities that would open before me. Soon we started
                to learn about the Programming Language of Scratch, which was to help introduce us to coding concepts.
                Because of my experience with programming, learning how to use Scratch was fairly simple, and I soon
                became someone that the other members of the teams could ask questions and receive help from for the
                language. However, Covid-19 was a huge dampener on everything, so everything was far slower, and it was
                impossible for us to travel and take part in competitions that year. Due to some big changes, the time I
                was able to put in the Barbados Robotics Team slowly dwindled down until my activity reached a
                standstill in January of 2021</p>

            <h2>Private Caribbean Study Goals</h2>
            <p>Shortly after becoming a member of the Barbados Robotics Team (BRT), I met with 16 year old Jasmine
                Greene, Founder of Private Caribbean Study Goals, an organisation created to help students from around
                the Caribbean that were doing CSEC & CAPE Exams, and a fellow member of the Barbados Robotics Team.
                After one of the Barbados Robotics Team meetings, I was invited by Ms.Greene, to one of her meetings
                that she was having at the time. Having heard of my "skills" from the BRT, I was asked if I could make a
                page for her organisation. After explaining that my design skills weren't all the best, and that I
                hadn't made a website in a long time (The Barbados Robotics Team website was made using Webflow.io), she
                continued to insist. The biggest problem at the time was that all of her large website is done using
                google sites, and I had no idea of how to integrate a page done in code into said site. Eventually, the
                idea was disregarded, and I no longer had to struggle with that field that I do not fancy. However, at
                this time, Ms.Greene had a discord server already up and running with over 1000 students, and was now in
                need of some discord bots to help her manage everything. This, is the field that I specialized in. I
                accepted her request and then created 1 moderator bot, and 3 music bots and 2 timer bots, in about 2
                weeks, all made specifically for her server. As time continued and PCSG continued to grow, I began to
                feel even more inspired to get my own business up and running. On the 27th of February 2021, Ms.Greene
                and I formed a partnership between our 2 businesses.
