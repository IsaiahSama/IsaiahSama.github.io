  <h2>Hey there, I'm Isaiah!</h2>
  <p>
   I'm currently a student at the University of the West Indies, doing a double major in Computer Science!
  </p>
  <p>
   In terms of hobbies, I'm a huge fan of playing Legend of Zelda (all of them), watching youtube, and building out whatever weird projects my brain comes up with.
  </p>
  <p>
    But of course, that's not all I do. Unofficially, I also lightly
    dabble in various other fields such as Godot, AR experiences, Pixelart and
    even modelling (with Blender 3D)!

  <p>Thank you for visiting this page, I hope you enjoy your stay!</p>
